## Pong Game

This is a game that I made in python but with some help out from Youtube.
The pong game is a classic game that was one of the first games that came out.

This game uses the Turtle game engine

### Install

Run the game by running the main file

```
python3 main.py
```

### Playing Game

* To play the game use arrow keys  
* You play against a bot



### ToDo
* Need to make bouncing less predictable
* Make the look more fancy
